## Main Assignments

##### The tasks:

1. **Interactive Typography:** Produce interactive typography that responds to some input from the user, such as a mouse or keyboard interaction.
2. **Unconventional Micro-Interaction:** Microinteractions are small moments where the user and design interact, such as in the individual interface components. Choose a typical micro-interaction such as volume control, or colour selector, and create a playful reinterpretation. 

## The Outcome

##### My projects:

- **Project01 Typography:** 
*For my first project I wanted to practise oscillations and wave patterns. That's why I decided to use the wavy text strings to create interactive patterns.*
- **Project02 Typography:**
*I didn't need much external help for my first project, but I thought it was too simple, so I tried a second one: The closer the mouse cursor is to the displayed text, the shakier it gets until it finally "explodes" with a mouse click. This was a bit more complicated, which is why I needed more external help to get the code up and running.*
- **Project03 Micro-Interaction:**
*The micro-interaction was the most difficult of all. I wanted to create a game where you have to catch the on-off button, which flits across the screen and gets faster every time. I worked with AI to generate three tips on how to approach the code. If that didn't work, I had the AI check the code and explain why it didn't work. I wish I could have gotten the code to work on my own, but that wasn't the case. Nevertheless, I learned something.*
